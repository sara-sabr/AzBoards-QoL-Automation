# Localization

These json files are used as a mechanism to display the "labels" of the screen in the user's language.
There is no support for translating any user content as that'll require sending the content to a third
party service/API/AI/etc which can lead to privacy concerns.

The localization files is as follows:
- en.json: English file (default)
- fr.json: French file

Later on, it might make sense to have each component have it's own translation file,
however for ease of maintenance, all translation keys will reside here for now.
