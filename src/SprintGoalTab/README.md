# Sprint Goal Tab

Some of the ideas were copied from [Azure DevOps - Sprint Goal
](https://github.com/keesschollaart81/vsts-sprint-goal).

However, this differs as removing the need for the custom extension data:
- A new work item will be created just to store the data
- At worst case, if the extension stops working, at least one can still query out the goals based on Work Item Type.
